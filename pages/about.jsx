              More than once in my life someone tells me, “Jim, you are not like
              any other programmer we know.” I am not sure if I should take it
              as a compliment, or thinking people suggesting that I am not that
              good of a programmer. Then they tell me, I am a lot approachable
              than other programmers, and I actually have a “personality”,
              unlike some others.

              When I learn and work on a project, I not only think from the
              technology-side of it, but also from the user-side of it. I don’t
              like to just write an application for others to use, but I want to
              write an application that make it easy for users to run their
              business, without make a lot of changes to what they are already
              doing. That’s why I am not only good with coding, but also good
              with talking and communicating with people. I guess that’s why a
              lot of people would rather work with me.

              My Skills-wise, I started doing a lot of classic ASP, then decided
              to move to PHP, and that was about ten years ago. I don’t like the
              traditional way of learning by just sitting in the classroom, that
              just puts me to sleep within five minutes. I learn what I need to
              learn by reading books, online video tutorials broken down into
              lessons with hands-on exercises, so I can ‘see’ what I code in. I
              work extra hard to get where I am today. Now I have been working a
              combination of web technology including HTML, PHP, MySQL, CSS,
              JavaScript, and JQuery.

              I love movies, whenever I have a free time I check out what good
              movies are playing, or are available on DVD or Blu-Ray. I also
              love to travel, though I don’t do it as much as before (probably
              because of lack of money and time). I love Japanese food, I can
              have Japanese food every day. One other thing I like is music. I
              don’t play any instrument or anything but I like to listen to
              music while I work. It keeps my mind focused to what I do. One of
              my favorite quote from the movie August Rush:
            </p>
            <p>“The music is all around us, all you have to do .. is listen”</p>
            <p>
              I don’t want to bore you with a lot of details, check out my
              portfolio page for the work I am proud to showcase here. If you
              have questions or just want to drop in a line saying “Hey Jim, I
              have been here” in the Contact Me page, I’d appreciate it, too.
              For now, take care of youself, and may God bless you.
